      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Users enjoy cooking, but find they don’t cook as often as they like because they’re short on time, ingredients or both. The app aims to help motivate users to cook even under these circumstances by helping users easily search recipes with just a few ingredients.</p>

    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>I interviewed a pool of five people on their daily cooking habits. I selected people that enjoy cooking recreationally and hypothesized that they might be inclined to cook more often if not for certain pain points. I devised a research script of about 15 questions to find out what some of these pain points might be. My user research surfaced pain points such as lack of time, missing ingredients, and just being too hungry to want to find a new recipe.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes for Search</h2>
    <p>The app is designed to get the user in and searching for recipes as quickly as possible. The first screen a user will see when they start the app is the search screen prompting them to enter ingredients. </p>

  <div class="project-text-col">
   <p>In a successful search recipes matching the criteria entered by the user are displayed with an image, the recipe name and information that might be important to the user in evaluating whether they want to make the recipe such as cook time or difficulty. In an unsuccessful search the user is given the option to start a new search or browse recipes with similar ingredients.</p>

  <div class="project-text-col">
   <p>Once a user selects a recipe they land on the recipe screen. In the first iteration of the app the user could select ingredients and them to a shopping list to help with meal planning. This later got simplified by restricting the recipe search to ingredients that a user has plus a few staples. </p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>In the initial designs for the app I thought it would be important for the user to be able to filter and refine searches to help them find the right recipe to make and I focused on finding all the possible criteria a user could use to filter such as cuisine, top rated recipes, newly added, etc. But, in user testing I discovered that users found the sidebar with all the options for filtering overwhelming. </p>
    <p>I also found out through testing that most users evaluated the recipes based on the appeal of the images over other factors like main ingredients, difficulty or cook time. Users also preferred curated images over images uploaded by other users.</p>

  <div class="project-text-col segment-border-top">
    <h2>The Next Iteration</h2>
    <p>One issue that came up in  testing was that searches would return recipes based on the ingredients that the user entered, but the recipes also might include ingredients the user might not have.  The test pool agreed that not having some ingredients would deter them from making a recipe.</p>

    <p class="space-after">In the next iteration of the app I intend to solve the issue of the user not having ingredients, by allowing the user to build a pantry of staple ingredients that they are always likely to have hand such as butter, flour, pasta, canned foods, etc., that would always be added to the search for specific ingredients. The user would be able to specify what staple ingredients they are likely to always have during onboarding, so they would still be able search as quickly once they get into the app.</p>
