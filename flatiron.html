    <p class="project-subhead">Redesign of the Flatiron School’s marketing site. The goal of the redesign was to better inform visitors to the site about the full range of course offerings, the overall experience and outcomes of past graduates.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>The existing marketing was heavily focused on the in-person web development immersive and didn’t promote the online program as an equivilant option. It wasn't communicating the course offerings and experience in a way that helped the users to decide if they should attend Flatiron and which course was right for them.</p>

  <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>I collaborated closely with the design lead from the initial UX phase through to launch. I focused primarily on three informational pages: Events, Hire Our Grads and About Us.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-text-col">
    <h2 class="separator-small">Research and Wireframes</h2>
    <p>We held a series of informational meetings with internal stakeholders. The design lead also conducted a series of interviews with students and alumni to determine what criteria was important when assessing what coding bootcamp to attend. We found that most students heavily research programs before and want to know as much as possible about the program before making a decision. </p>

    <h2>The Events Page</h2>
    <p>The main focus of the events page is helping a user find an upcoming event quickly and easily. Events are listed in date order and can be filtered by in person or online. The event list was designed to be easily scanable with date and location information listed on the left and the registration link on the right. </p>

    <h2>The About Us Page</h2>
    <p>The About Us page tells the story of Flatiron’s origin, mission and people. It showcases the people behind the school and what makes the school unique. The graphic in the middle of the page highlights Flatiron's five core values that all students and employees should embody:  work together, radiate positivity, be scrappy, pursue mastery and make no little plans. </p>

    <h2>The Hire Our Grads Page</h2>
    <p>This page showcases students outcomes and graduate success stories. The intended audience is not only current and prospective students, but also potential employers and hiring partners.</p>

<div class="project-text-col segment-border-top">
  <h2>Visual Design</h2>
  <p>We wanted the experience of moving from the marketing site into the product to feel cohesive visually, but Flatiron School and it's online learning platform, Learn each had their own branding and visual style. Flatiron's branding is rigorous shades of blues and grey with lots of strong angles and straight lines. Learn's branding is more colorful and friendly with green, purple, yellow and blue and more curves. We wanted to combine elements of both into the visual style.</p>

  <p>Hero images are the strong Flatiron blue, but the UI is peppered with accents of purple and green picked up from the product. Button and input styles are the rounded styles used in the product. And, we incorporated the strong diagonals as dividers in image collages that appear throughout the site.</p>
